Try replacing some of your duties with measurable results and accomplishments rather than duties. Remember, "duties tell, accomplishments sell." To create a strong measurable result, try this format: [Action verb] [brief explanation of accomplishment] resulting in [quantifiable outcome. Using %,$, etc. will draw the eye and make an impact]. For example: "Responded to an average of 203 customer service emails per week, improving response timeby 74% and customer satisfaction by 31% between 2016 to 2017." You can also say that you had experience with relevant engineering technologies like PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, AWS, and MySQL in on a customer-facing product.",
